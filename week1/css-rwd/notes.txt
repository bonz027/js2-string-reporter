Responsive Web Design!
    - Adapting your design to fit different devices

Why?
    - Wide range of devices, capabilities, and sizes

How are these devices different?
    - Network speed and data limits
    - Touch/swipe interface vs click/hover
    - Display size / pixel density
    - Portrait vs landscape
    - Aspect Ratio
    - Operating system / browser

Outdated Practice of serving multiple sites

Designers
    Most tools that designers use don't really accomodate RWD
    Open communication is key

Mobile-First Development
    - Designing a site for mobile primarily
    - Progressive Enhancement
        * As the screen size increases, we can add more features or change the layout of our site
Desktop-First X
    - Graceful Degradation
        * often not as graceful as you would like
        * End up ripping out features as the screen gets smaller

Media Queries
    - Apply CSS based on certain conditions

    .papadiv{
        background-color:red;
    }
    @media (min-width:768px){
        .papadiv{
            background-color:blue;
        }
    }
    @media (min-width:1024px){
        .papadiv{
            background-color:blue;
        }
    }
    
    - Mobile/base styles
    - Media Queries (min-width) that increase in size
